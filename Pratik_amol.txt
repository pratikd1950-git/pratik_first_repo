Important Data
A few common things people mean (tell me which one fits, or add your own):
Use Git with Python projects that process data
(best practices for versioning datasets, .gitignore, DVC, etc.)
Access data from GitHub using Python
(clone repos, download CSV/JSON files, use the GitHub API)
Control Git from Python code
(using gitpython, running git commands programmatically)
Data science workflow with Git
(branching, experiments, notebooks, reproducibility)
Something else entirely — quick description works
